Plugin Check is a validation tool for PHP developers (and a quality checker for end users) to locate undefined functions and methods.

== Description ==

> <strong>Sunset Edition</strong><br>
> This update of the plugin is the last publicly released version. We do not expect to make any serious changes or add new features to it from now on.
>
> We may not always be able to provide prompt support for this plugin on the WordPress.org forums. If you would like to have professional support or extra/custom features, consider buying the [Pro version](http://buy.thulasidas.com/plugin-check "Plugin Check to detect undefined functions and methods, $5.95").

*Plugin Check* is a developer tool. It scans the plugin or application you specify (or upload) and determines whether you have undefined functions or methods in it.

PHP is not a compiled language. It looks for functions during runtime. So if you have a segment of code not covered by your normal testing, and you have an undefined function in there, you will never know of the undefined function until it hits production when the particular conditions activating that particular code segment are met. This tool will prove especially useful during large scale refactoring, or for quality checking for submission to sites like CodeCanyon.

> Live Demo
>
> Plugin Check has a beautifully designed admin interface, which is feature-rich, user-friendly and functional. Please visit this fully operational [live demo site](http://demo.thulasidas.com/plugin-check "Play with Plugin Check Pro") to see it in action.

 **Now available in your language using Google Translate.**

* *Modern Admin Interface*: Plugin Check sports a modern and beautiful admin interface based on the twitter bootstrap framework. Fully responsive.
* *Admin Interface Tour*: A slick tour will take you around the admin page and familiarize you with its features.
* *Generous Help*: Whenever you need help, the information and hint is only a click away in Plugin Check. (In fact, it is only a mouseover away.)
* *Standalone Mode*: Plugin Check  works as a WordPress plugin if uploaded to the `wp-content/plugins` folder of your blog, or as a standalone application if uploaded to your server. What's more, you can switch to the standalone mode from the WordPress plugin admin page of this plugin, while still using the WordPress authentication mechanism and database.

* *Automated Checks*: With the *Pro* version, you can run a suite of checks (adapted and further developed from the excellent Theme Check plugin) on the plugin as well.
* *WordPress Aware*: The *Pro* version is aware of WordPress functions and their deprecation status. It also knows the common global variables in WordPress.
* *Skinnable Admin Interface*: In the *Pro* version, you can select the color schemes of your admin pages from nine different skins.
* *Advanced Options*: The Pro version lets you configure advanced options like suppressing duplicates, displaying all detected tokens etc.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this program do? =

*Plugin Check* is a developer tool. It scans the plugin you specify and determines whether you have undefined functions or methods. In the Pro version, you can also run it on plugins or applications by uploading them (without having to install them). Furthermore, you can run a suite of checks (adapted from the excellent Theme Check plugin) on the code as well.

= What are the tabs Plugin Checker, App Checker and Run Checks? =

Plugin Checker is to look for undefined functions and methods in a plugin installed on your blog.

App Checker does the same, but for applications or files already on your server or by uploading a plugin or an application as a zip file. Note that uploaded plugin or app is not installed and will be cleaned up after validation.

Run Checks is to run a set of automated checks (copied from the excellent Theme Check plugin) on your plugin (either on your blog or uploaded).

= What do I enter in "List of Files"? =

You enter the path names of the files you would like to validate. Note that *Plugin Check* runs on your server, and the files need to be accessible by your web server. Please specify the files relative to your `wp-content/plugins` directory, or by typing in their full path names. You can enter multiple file names separated by commas.

= What do I enter in "Folder Location"? =

*Plugin Check* can recursively load an entire folder on your server to validate the files therein. Specify a path relative to your `wp-content/plugins`  location (as shown in the help bubble), or as an absolute path.

= What about "Upload Application"? =

Using this file upload method, you can upload an entire PHP application (as a ZIP file) to your server and validate it by pseudo-compiling it. The uploaded ZIP file will be unpacked into a temporary folder and scanned for undefined functions and methods. Since the temporary locations have random names and cannot execute PHP files through external invocations, the security risk is believed to be non-existent.

= How do I use the "Select a Plugin" dropdown menu? =

Similar to the file upload method, you can validate any plugin installed on your WordPress server (both active and inactive ones) by pseudo-compiling it. Select a plugin and wait for the output.
